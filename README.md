# DND-5thE
First Submission, sorry if there are extra files. Pretty basic, the program will prompt for your name, race, class ect. A few things to note:
It is still being worked on, currently I have a list of a few bugs that I need to work on.
1. You can enter values twice when assigning stats. I added a list of words you still have availible to use, just be a bit careful
2. Make sure that you enter the race correctly, if entered incorrectly you will NOT recieve any neccisary boosters to your character.
(and yes, you can just enter elf instead of specifing something like half-elf, you only get a small stat boost)
Hope it helps to save some time for the people trying to DnD like a champ
